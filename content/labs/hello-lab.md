# Welcome to Cyber Grader

This mini lab introduces the grading workflow. Read the instructions and submit the requested flags.

1. Run `echo "FLAG{hello-world}"` to reveal the first flag.
2. Generate a random adjective and submit it in the format `FLAG{<word>-regex}`.

Good luck and have fun hacking responsibly!
